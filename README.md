# Cardinal
Cardinal is a World of Warcraft addon designed to replace the minimap and associated 'cluster' features with a cardinal direction & objective HUD Ã  la Skyrim, Fallout, DOOM Eternal, etc.

### Known Issues:

* Pins are not created on login (/reload once logged in and everything should be corrected)
* Pins are not properly reset (old pins removed, new pins created) when using hearthstone; city/mage portal; wormhole generator
  * For example, if using a Shadowlands Wormhole Generator to travel to The Maw the pins from the previous zone are present on the HUD *and* their directions are actually accurate to the zone's position on the world map relative to The Maw. <sub><sup>*This is possibly a feature instead of a bug???*</sup></sub>
*  Daily quests in The Maw are not properly handled
*  Callings are represented by a plain <b style="color:rgb(255, 209.1, 0)">!</b> instead of their normal blue campaign quest symbol
