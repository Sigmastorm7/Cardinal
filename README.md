# Cardinal

Cardinal is a World of Warcraft addon designed to replace the minimap and associated 'cluster' features with a cardinal direction display.

WARNING: If you have any addons enabled that use HereBeDragons as dependency or optional dependency (HandyNotes for example) THEY WILL BREAK. I've modified a copy of HBDPins.lua within this addon's files and I am working to correct this by integrating the HBD functionality I need directly into Cardinal.
